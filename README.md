The **GPS NMEA Emulator** is a simple script that emulates a GPS receiver (simulates unit's movement). Data generated by the script are sent to clients in **NMEA 0183** format. 
This script can be useful for testing applications or systems that require some unit's GPS position data.

The script is a highly modified script based on the script originally created by GitHub user [luk-kop](https://github.com/luk-kop/nmea-gps-emulator/) and published on GitHub.
The code has been documented and modified to use decimal coordinates, to allow input of altitude, logging to file and other changes.

The **GPS NMEA Emulator** script can be used in one of the following operating modes:
- NMEA TCP Stream (sends TCP packets to the specified client),
- NMEA UDP Stream (sends UDP packets to the specified client),
- NMEA TCP Server (the server waits for client connections, then sends TCP packets to the connected clients - max 10 connections)
- NMEA Serial (transmit serial data on specified RS port).
- NMEA messages filtered by type logged to a file
***
## Features
- The script allows the user to enter the following data:
  - unit's position;
  - unit's speed;
  - unit's course;
  - unit's altitude
  - operating mode selection (NMEA Serial, NMEA TCP Server, NMEA TCP or UDP Stream);
  - IP address & port pair or serial port name.
- After the NMEA data transmission has started, the script allows the user to interactively change the speed and course of the unit.
- Generated NMEA sentences are resent to the selected clients periodically (every second). Each time a data with NMEA sentences is sent, the position of the unit is updated based on its speed and course.

List of NMEA sentences generated by **GPS NMEA Emulator** script:
```
GPGGA - Global Positioning System Fix Data
GPGLL - Position data: position fix, time of position fix, and status
GPRMC - Recommended minimum specific GPS/Transit data
GPGSA - GPS DOP and active satellites
GPGSV - GPS Satellites in view
GPHDT - True Heading
GPVTG - Track made good and ground speed
GPZDA - Date & Time
```
Output example:
```
$GPGGA,173124.00,5430.000,N,01921.029,E,1,09,0.92,15.2,M,32.5,M,,*6C

## Getting Started

Below instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Requirements

Python third party packages:
* [pyproj](https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/)
* [pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/)
* [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/)

In order to use **NMEA Serial** mode correctly, it is necessary to use dedicated serial **null modem** cable.

On Linux systems you will probably need to change the permissions for the device matching your serial port before running the script.
```bash
# Example command for /dev/ttyS0 device
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyS0
```

### Installation with virtual environment
The script can be build and run locally with virtualenv tool. Run following commands in order to create virtual environment and install the required packages.
```bash
$ python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install pyproj
(venv) $ pip install pyserial
(venv) $ pip install psutil
(venv) $ pip install pygeomag
```
### Running the script
You can start the script using the following command:
```bash
(venv) $ python main.py
```
After starting the script correctly, the following prompt should appear in the OS console:

```bash
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
..####...#####....####...........######..##...##..##..##..##.......####...######...####...#####..
.##......##..##..##..............##......###.###..##..##..##......##..##....##....##..##..##..##.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
based on source code by luk-kop
                      
### Choose emulator mode: ###
### -------------------------------- ###
1 - NMEA Serial port output
2 - NMEA TCP Server
3 - NMEA TCP or UDP Stream
4 - NMEA output to log (only GPGGA)
0 - Quit
>>>
```

After selecting the mode, user is prompted for input of latitude, longitude, speed, heading and altitude.

```bash
### Enter unit position latitude (defaults to 57.70011131502446): ###
>>> 59.27567459

### Enter unit position latitude hemisphere (defaults to N): ###
>>> N

### Enter unit position longitude (defaults to 11.988278521104876): ###
>>> 15.21254755

### Enter unit position longitude hemisphere (defaults to E): ###
>>> E

### Enter unit course - range 000-359 degrees (defaults to 45): ###
>>> 45

### Enter unit speed in knots - range 0-999 (defaults to 2 knots): ###
>>> 2

### Enter unit altitude in meters above sea level - range -40-9000 (defaults to 42): ###
>>> 42
```

### Filtering messages when logging
When logging mode i chosen can the NMEA messages be filtered by type to allow testing and debugging. The input below will be shown after coordinate input.

```bash

```
